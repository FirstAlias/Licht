# Licht2D

The boilerplate code (most of the code written so far) was not written by me, I followed a tutorial by Mr. Creel:

Licht2D is meant to be a 2D Engine for Game and Application development. Currently, it's very much unfinished.

I'm a beginner in software development with C++, and Licht2D is a project I will work on to learn the Windows API, Direct2D, C++, and software development. I'll later create branches of this project that will use the 2D features of Direct3D, Vulkan, and OpenGL.
Although Licht2D is a software that I'm developing so I can learn and improve, it would be great if it could be of use to anyone.

In the near future, I'll develop Licht3D (a 3D engine that will have Direct3D, Vulkan, and OpenGL branches) and LichtCUDA (an interface, engine-like software for CUDA development or the development of GPU-intensive software) (I'm not at all knowledgeable in this topic, yet).
